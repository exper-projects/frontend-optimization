## Render Blocking

- Refers to `resources` that `prevent the browser from rendering the page` (i.e., displaying content to the user) until they are `fully loaded or processed`
- Typically `involves CSS and JavaScript`. The browser needs to `load and apply CSS` to ensure the page is styled correctly, and it needs to `load JavaScript` that may modify the DOM or add interactivity
