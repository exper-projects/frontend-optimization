## HTML Parsing and DOM Creation

- The browser `downloads the HTML files` and `begins parsing it` line by line
- It `constructs the DOM` (Document Object Model)
- Parsing `may be blocked by <script> tags` unless they are marked as `async` or `defer`
- Javascript files are `render-blocking resources`
